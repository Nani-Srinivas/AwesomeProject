My plan is to:

  Phase 1: Backend API for Editing Attendance (Server-side)
   1. Create/Update API Endpoint: Implement a PUT or PATCH endpoint (e.g., /api/attendance/:customerId/:date) on the Fastify
      server to update attendance records, including customerId, date, and product details.
   2. Controller: Develop a new controller function to process, validate, and update the AttendanceLog.

  Phase 2: Integrate Frontend with Backend API
   1. Modify `handleSaveAttendance` in `AddAttendance.tsx`: After local state updates, make an apiService.put or
      apiService.patch call to the new endpoint, passing customerId, selectedDate, and product data. Handle API responses with
      toast messages and manage isLoading state.

  Phase 3: Refinement and Error Handling
   1. Client-side Validation: Add validation in EditAttendanceModal or handleSaveAttendance.
   2. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for the API call in handleSaveAttendance, using toast messages.

  I will now present this plan.
